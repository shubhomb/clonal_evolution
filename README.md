## Evolutionary Game Theoretic Modeling of Clonal Evolution in Multiple Myeloma
### Shubhom Bhattacharya and Sameer Lal
### Advised by Eva Tardos


In our M.Eng project, we modeled the dynamics of tumor growth in multiple myeloma, a cancer of blood plasma. Using evolutionary game theory, we try to characterize mutations and associated phenotypic fitness in terms of observed patterns of tumor growth.
