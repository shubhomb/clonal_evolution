Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 signal<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Labeled cRNA was hybridized to U133Plus2.0 GeneChips in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 and washed using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 as per the manufacturers protocol	Bone marrow aspirates were attained from patients after they signed informed consent documetnation	Signal estimates were generated in Expression Console (Affymetrix) using the MAS5 algorithm with default settings	Arrays were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 following the recommendations of the manufacturer	CD138 positive tumor cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirates using magnetic sorting, both Miltenyi and Stem Cell Technologies	RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) in combination with PureLink Micro-to-Midi RNA columns (Invitrogen) using the manufacturers protocol. RNA samples were tested for purity and concentration on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and quality checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer	2 ug of Total RNA was labeled using the One-Cycle Target Labeling kit from Affymetrix as per the manufacturers suggestion
